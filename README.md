## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and compare the performance of professional football (soccer) players, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as goals, shots on target, expected goals (xG), and more. The primary objective is to help users quickly identify top-performing forwards/strikers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers based on their on-field statistics.

## Data Sources
- **Player Stats**: A dataset containing player-specific information such as name, position, nationality, age, club, goals, shots, shots on target, expected goals (xG), minutes played, etc.
- **Leagues/Country Information (Optional)**: Additional tables or files providing metadata on leagues, competitions, or country data for further context.

> **Note**: If you have multiple data sources or files, list them here with links or references (e.g., CSV files, Excel workbooks, or database connections).


**Questions or Feedback?**  
If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to [open an issue](../../issues) in this repository.

Enjoy analyzing player performance with Power BI!
