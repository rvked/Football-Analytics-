## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and compare the performance of professional football (soccer) players, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as goals, shots on target, expected goals (xG), and more. The primary objective is to help users quickly identify top-performing forwards/strikers, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers based on their on-field statistics.

## Data Sources
- **Player Stats**: A dataset containing player-specific information such as name, position, nationality, age, club, goals, shots, shots on target, expected goals (xG), minutes played, etc.
- **Leagues/Country Information (Optional)**: Additional tables or files providing metadata on leagues, competitions, or country data for further context.

> **Note**: If you have multiple data sources or files, list them here with links or references (e.g., CSV files, Excel workbooks, or database connections).

- **Data/**: Contains all raw and processed data files.
- **Dashboard/**: Holds the Power BI `.pbix` file.
- **Images/**: Stores any images or screenshots used for documentation.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and usage instructions.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/player-performance-analysis.git
   cd player-performance-analysis
   ```
2. **Download & Install Power BI Desktop**  
   - If you haven’t installed Power BI Desktop, [download it here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

3. **Open the Dashboard**  
   - Open `PlayerPerformance.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.

4. **Connect or Update Data Sources**  
   - In Power BI, go to **Transform Data** (Power Query Editor) if you need to update file paths or database connections.
   - Make sure the data sources are accessible (e.g., correct file paths or database credentials).

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Launch Power BI Desktop** and open `PlayerPerformance.pbix`.
2. Wait for the data to load and refresh.
3. Navigate through the different tabs (e.g., **Forwards/Strikers**, **Midfielders**, **Defenders**, **Goalkeepers**, **Overall Team**) to explore different views of player data.

## Visualizations
Each page in the dashboard is designed to highlight relevant KPIs for specific player positions:

1. **Forward/Strikers Page**  
   - **Table**: Displays each striker’s name, nationality, age, goals, shots, shots on target, expected goals (xG), etc.  
   - **Line Charts**: Track changes in metrics like shots on target ratio or conversion rate across different players.  
   - **Scatter/Bubble Plot**: Compare multiple KPIs simultaneously (e.g., total shots vs. goals scored).

2. **Midfielders Page**  
   - Similar structure but focuses on midfield-specific metrics such as assists, key passes, or chances created.

3. **Defenders Page**  
   - Highlights defensive stats like tackles, interceptions, clearances, etc.

4. **Goalkeepers Page**  
   - Showcases goalkeeper stats like saves, clean sheets, save percentage, etc.

5. **Overall Team Page** (Optional)  
   - Provides aggregated statistics per team or league, allowing you to see how a team performs overall.

## Filtering & Navigation
- **Slicers/Filters**: Use filters (often on the right-hand pane or top slicers) to narrow down players by league, nationality, club, or age range.
- **Interactive Charts**: Click on chart elements to cross-filter other visuals and isolate data for specific players or teams.
- **Reset Filters**: Use the “Reset to default” button in Power BI if you need to revert to the original view.
